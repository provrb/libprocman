## Building
To build the tests executable:
1. Open your terminal and change to the project directory
2. Run the following command in the terminal.  **Note: Your g++ installation must support C++20!**
    - `cmake -B build -G Ninja`
3. Build the executable with the following command:
    - `cmake --build build`
4. Run the tests using:
    - `./build/libprocman.exe`

Any time you'd like to refactor or implement a new feature, you want to make sure your new features pass all tests.

## Installation
1. Go to the repositorys releases [page](https://github.com/provrb/libprocman/releases)
2. Choose your version; preferbly the latest release.

Depending on your use case, you can choose to pick from different file formats: 

1. **.CPP and .HPP file**: simply drag the files into your include directories and include the .hpp file
2. **.lib or .dll**: make sure to link the file to expose the functions.

## Usage
1. Include the procman.hpp and procman.cpp files in your project.
2. Create an instance of the ProcessManager class
3. Use the features provided by the class. Feel free to add your own functions!
